Hi, I’m `@ljknot` also known as `Knot`. I am 26 turning 27 this year. I recently got into programming and I am loving every second of it. I don't know how to use any programs at the second but that won't stop me from learning
- 'I’m interested in game design, app design, AI, web development'
-  `I’m currently learning how to code in javascript.`
-  How to reach me ljknot96@gmail.com feel free to email about tips, hints, or just for conversation. I would like to familiarize myself with this field and people working within. I look forward to hearing from you.
